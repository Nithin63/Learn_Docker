            <h2> What is containerization? </h2>
            <p>Containerization has become a major trend in software development as an alternative or companion to
                virtualization. It involves encapsulating or packaging up software code and all its dependencies so that
                it
                can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure. The technology is quickly maturing, resulting
                in
                measurable benefits for developers and operations teams as well as overall software infrastructure.</p>

            <p> Containerization allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely. With
                traditional methods, code is developed in a specific computing environment which, when transferred to a
                new
                location, often results in bugs and errors. For example, when a developer transfers code from a desktop
                computer to a virtual machine (VM) or from a Linux to a Windows operating system. Containerization
                eliminates this problem by bundling the application code together with the related configuration files,
                libraries, and dependencies required for it to run. This single package of software or “container” is
                abstracted away from the host operating system, and hence, it stands alone and becomes portable—able to
                run
                across any platform or cloud, free of issues.</p>


            <img src="img/1_VxAJ5aCzUJtmVhdg290RXg.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br>
        <br>

            <p> The concept of containerization and process isolation is decades old, but the emergence of the open
                source
                Docker Engine in 2013, an industry standard for containers with simple developer tools and a universal
                packaging approach, accelerated the adoption of this technology. Research firm Gartner projects that
                more
                than 50% of companies will use container technology by 2020. And results from a late 2017 survey
                conducted
                by IBM suggest that adoption is happening even faster, revealing that 59% of adopters improved
                application
                quality and reduced defects as a result.</p>

            <p> Containers are often referred to as “lightweight,” meaning they share the machine’s operating system
                kernel
                and do not require the overhead of associating an operating system within each application. Containers
                are
                inherently smaller in capacity than a VM and require less start-up time, allowing far more containers to
                run
                on the same compute capacity as a single VM. This drives higher server efficiencies and, in turn,
                reduces
                server and licensing costs.</p>

            <p> Put simply, containerization allows applications to be “written once and run anywhere.” This portability
                is
                important in terms of the development process and vendor compatibility. It also offers other notable
                benefits, like fault isolation, ease of management and security, to name a few. Click here to learn more
                about the benefits of containerization.</p>

        <br>

            <h2> Application containerization</h2>
            <p> Containers encapsulate an application as a single executable package of software that bundles
                application
                code together with all of the related configuration files, libraries, and dependencies required for it
                to
                run. Containerized applications are “isolated” in that they do not bundle in a copy of the operating
                system.
                Instead, an open source runtime engine (such as the Docker runtime engine) is installed on the host’s
                operating system and becomes the conduit for containers to share an operating system with other
                containers
                on the same computing system.</p>

            <p> Other container layers, like common bins and libraries, can also be shared among multiple containers.
                This
                eliminates the overhead of running an operating system within each application and makes containers
                smaller
                in capacity and faster to start up, driving higher server efficiencies. The isolation of applications as
                containers also reduces the chance that malicious code present in one container will impact other
                containers
                or invade the host system.</p>

            <p> The abstraction from the host operating system makes containerized applications portable and able to run
                uniformly and consistently across any platform or cloud. Containers can be easily transported from a
                desktop
                computer to a virtual machine (VM) or from a Linux to a Windows operating system, and they will run
                consistently on virtualized infrastructures or on traditional “bare metal” servers, either on-premise or
                in
                the cloud. This ensures that software developers can continue using the tools and processes they are
                most
                comfortable with.</p>

            <p> One can see why enterprises are rapidly adopting containerization as a superior approach to application
                development and management. Containerization allows developers to create and deploy applications faster
                and
                more securely, whether the application is a traditional monolith (a single-tiered software application)
                or a
                modular microservice (a collection of loosely coupled services). New cloud-based applications can be
                built
                from the ground up as containerized microservices, breaking a complex application into a series of
                smaller
                specialized and manageable services. Existing applications can be repackaged into containers (or
                containerized microservices) that use compute resources more efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p> Containerization offers significant benefits to developers and development teams. Among these are the
                following:</p>

            <p> Portability: A container creates an executable package of software that is abstracted away from (not
                tied to
                or dependent upon) the host operating system, and hence, is portable and able to run uniformly and
                consistently across any platform or cloud.</p>
            <p> Agility: The open source Docker Engine for running containers started the industry standard for
                containers
                with simple developer tools and a universal packaging approach that works on both Linux and Windows
                operating systems. The container ecosystem has shifted to engines managed by the Open Container
                Initiative
                (OCI). Software developers can continue using agile or DevOps tools and processes for rapid application
                development and enhancement.</p>
            <p> Speed: Containers are often referred to as “lightweight,” meaning they share the machine’s operating
                system
                (OS) kernel and are not bogged down with this extra overhead. Not only does this drive higher server
                efficiencies, it also reduces server and licensing costs while speeding up start-times as there is no
                operating system to boot.</p>
            <p> Fault isolation: Each containerized application is isolated and operates independently of others. The
                failure of one container does not affect the continued operation of any other containers. Development
                teams
                can identify and correct any technical issues within one container without any downtime in other
                containers.
                Also, the container engine can leverage any OS security isolation techniques—such as SELinux access
                control—to isolate faults within containers.</p>
            <p> Efficiency: Software running in containerized environments shares the machine’s OS kernel, and
                application
                layers within a container can be shared across containers. Thus, containers are inherently smaller in
                capacity than a VM and require less start-up time, allowing far more containers to run on the same
                compute
                capacity as a single VM. This drives higher server efficiencies, reducing server and licensing
                costs.</p>
            <p> Ease of management: A container orchestration platform automates the installation, scaling, and
                management
                of containerized workloads and services. Container orchestration platforms can ease management tasks
                such as
                scaling containerized apps, rolling out new versions of apps, and providing monitoring, logging and
                debugging, among other functions. Kubernetes, perhaps the most popular container orchestration system
                available, is an open source technology (originally open-sourced by Google, based on their internal
                project
                called Borg) that automates Linux container functions originally. Kubernetes works with many container
                engines, such as Docker, but it also works with any container system that conforms to the Open Container
                Initiative (OCI) standards for container image formats and runtimes.</p>
            <p> Security: The isolation of applications as containers inherently prevents the invasion of malicious code
                from affecting other containers or the host system. Additionally, security permissions can be defined to
                automatically block unwanted components from entering containers or limit communications with
                unnecessary
                resources.</p>
            <h2>Types</h2>
            <p> The rapid growth in interest and usage of container-based solutions has led to the need for standards
                around
                container technology and the approach to packaging software code. The Open Container Initiative (OCI),
                established in June 2015 by Docker and other industry leaders, is promoting common, minimal, open
                standards
                and specifications around container technology. Because of this, the OCI is helping to broaden the
                choices
                for open source engines. Users will not be locked into a particular vendor’s technology, but rather they
                will be able to take advantage of OCI-certified technologies that allow them to build containerized
                applications using a diverse set of DevOps tools and run these consistently on the infrastructure(s) of
                their choosing.</p>

            <p> Today, Docker is one of the most well-known and highly used container engine technologies, but it is not
                the
                only option available. The ecosystem is standardizing on containerd and other alternatives like CoreOS
                rkt,
                Mesos Containerizer, LXC Linux Containers, OpenVZ, and crio-d. Features and defaults may differ, but
                adopting and leveraging OCI specifications as these evolve will ensure that solutions are
                vendor-neutral,
                certified to run on multiple operating systems and usable in multiple environments.</p>


            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p> can operate independently of other containers. Truly isolated, this could prevent any malicious code
                from
                affecting other containers or invading the host system. However, application layers within a container
                are
                often shared across containers. In terms of resource efficiency, this is a plus, but it also opens the
                door
                to interference and security breaches across containers. The same could be said of the shared Operating
                System since multiple containers can be associated with the same host Operating System. Security threats
                to
                the common Operating System can impact all of the associated containers, and conversely, a container
                breach
                can potentially invade the host Operating System.</p>

            <p> But, what about the container image itself? How can the applications and open source components packaged
                within a container improve security? Container technology providers, such as Docker, continue to
                actively
                address container security challenges. Containerization has taken a “secure-by-default” approach,
                believing
                that security should be inherent in the platform and not a separately deployed and configured solution.
                To
                this end, the container engine supports all of the default isolation properties inherent in the
                underlying
                operating system. Security permissions can be defined to automatically block unwanted components from
                entering containers or to limit communications with unnecessary resources.</p>

            <p> For example, Linux Namespaces helps to provide an isolated view of the system to each container; this
                includes networking, mount points, process IDs, user IDs, inter-process communication, and hostname
                settings. Namespaces can be used to limit access to any of those resources through processes within each
                container. Typically, subsystems which do not have Namespace support are not accessible from within a
                container. Administrators can easily create and manage these “isolation constraints” on each
                containerized
                application through a simple user interface.</p>

            <p> Researchers are working to further strengthen Linux container security, and a wide range of security
                solutions are available to automate threat detection and response across an enterprise, to monitor and
                enforce compliance to meet industry standards and security policies, to ensure the secure flow of data
                through applications and endpoints, and much more.</p>
