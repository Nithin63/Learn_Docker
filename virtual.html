            <h2>What is virtualization?</h2>

            <p>Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the
                hardware
                elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual
                computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs). Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and
                behaves
                like an independent computer, even though it is running on just a portion of the actual underlying
                computer
                hardware.</p>
            <p>
                It follows that virtualization enables more efficient utilization of physical computer hardware and
                allows a
                greater return on an organization’s hardware investment.</p>
            <p>
                Today, virtualization is a standard practice in enterprise IT architecture. It is also the technology
                that
                drives cloud computing economics. Virtualization enables cloud providers to serve users with their
                existing
                physical computer hardware; it enables cloud users to purchase only the computing resources they need
                when
                they need it, and to scale those resources cost-effectively as their workloads grow.</p>
            <p>
                Virtualization is technology that lets you create useful IT services using resources that are
                traditionally
                bound to hardware. It allows you to use a physical machine’s full capacity by distributing its
                capabilities
                among many users or environments.</p>
            <p>
                In more practical terms, imagine you have 3 physical servers with individual dedicated purposes. One is
                a
                mail server, another is a web server, and the last one runs internal legacy applications. Each server is
                being used at about 30% capacity—just a fraction of their running potential. But since the legacy apps
                remain important to your internal operations, you have to keep them and the third server that hosts
                them,
                right?</p>


            <img src="img/1.server-usage-500x131.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br>
            <br>


            <p> Traditionally, yes. It was often easier and more reliable to run individual tasks on individual servers:
                1
                server, 1 operating system, 1 task. It wasn’t easy to give 1 server multiple brains. But with
                virtualization, you can split the mail server into 2 unique ones that can handle independent tasks so
                the
                legacy apps can be migrated. It’s the same hardware, you’re just using more of it more efficiently.</p>

            <br>


            <p>
            <h2> Benefits of virtualization</h2>
            Virtualization brings several benefits to data center operators and service providers:

            Resource efficiency: Before virtualization, each application server required its own dedicated physical
            CPU—IT staff would purchase and configure a separate server for each application they wanted to run. (IT
            preferred one application and one operating system (OS) per computer for reliability reasons.) Invariably,
            each physical server would be underused. In contrast, server virtualization lets you run several
            applications—each on its own VM with its own OS—on a single physical computer (typically an x86 server)
            without sacrificing reliability. This enables maximum utilization of the physical hardware’s computing
            capacity.
            Easier management: Replacing physical computers with software-defined VMs makes it easier to use and manage
            policies written in software. This allows you to create automated IT service management workflows. For
            example, automated deployment and configuration tools enable administrators to define collections of virtual
            machines and applications as services, in software templates. This means that they can install those
            services repeatedly and consistently without cumbersome, time-consuming. and error-prone manual setup.
            Admins can use virtualization security policies to mandate certain security configurations based on the role
            of the virtual machine. Policies can even increase resource efficiency by retiring unused virtual machines
            to save on space and computing power.
            Minimal downtime: OS and application crashes can cause downtime and disrupt user productivity. Admins can
            run multiple redundant virtual machines alongside each other and failover between them when problems arise.
            Running multiple redundant physical servers is more expensive.
            Faster provisioning: Buying, installing, and configuring hardware for each application is time-consuming.
            Provided that the hardware is already in place, provisioning virtual machines to run all your applications
            is significantly faster. You can even automate it using management software and build it into existing
            workflows.</p>


            <p>
            <h2> Types of virtualization</h2>
            To this point we’ve discussed server virtualization, but many other IT infrastructure elements can be
            virtualized to deliver significant advantages to IT managers (in particular) and the enterprise as a whole.
            In this section, we'll cover the following types of virtualization:</p>

            <p> Desktop virtualization
                Network virtualization
                Storage virtualization
                Data virtualization
                Application virtualization
                Data center virtualization
                CPU virtualization
                GPU virtualization
                Linux virtualization
                Cloud virtualization
                Desktop virtualization</p>

            <p>
            <h2> Desktop virtualization </h2> lets you run multiple desktop operating systems, each in its own VM on the
            same
            computer.
            <img src="img/desktop%20virtualization_0.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br>
            <br>
            There are two types of desktop virtualization:

            Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) runs multiple desktops in VMs on a central server and streams them to
            users who log in on thin client devices. In this way, VDI lets an organization provide its users access to
            variety of OS's from any device, without installing OS's on any device. See "What is Virtual Desktop
            Infrastructure (VDI)?" for a more in-depth explanation.
            Local desktop virtualization runs a hypervisor on a local computer, enabling the user to run one or more
            additional OSs on that computer and switch from one OS to another as needed without changing anything about
            the primary OS.
            For more information on virtual desktops, see “Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS): A Complete Guide.”</p>

            <h2>Network virtualization</h2>
            <img src="img/network-function-virtualization-400x337_0.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br>
            <br>
            Network virtualization uses software to create a “view” of the network that an administrator can use to
            manage the network from a single console. It abstracts hardware elements and functions (e.g., connections,
            switches, routers, etc.) and abstracts them into software running on a hypervisor. The network administrator
            can modify and control these elements without touching the underlying physical components, which
            dramatically simplifies network management.</p>

            <p> Types of network virtualization include software-defined networking (SDN), which virtualizes hardware
                that
                controls network traffic routing (called the “control plane”), and network function virtualization
                (NFV),
                which virtualizes one or more hardware appliances that provide a specific network function (e.g., a
                firewall, load balancer, or traffic analyzer), making those appliances easier to configure, provision,
                and
                manage.</p>

            <p>
            <h2> Storage virtualization</h2></p>
            <p> Storage virtualization enables all the storage devices on the network— whether they’re installed on
                individual servers or standalone storage units—to be accessed and managed as a single storage device.
                Specifically, storage virtualization masses all blocks of storage into a single shared pool from which
                they
                can be assigned to any VM on the network as needed. Storage virtualization makes it easier to provision
                storage for VMs and makes maximum use of all available storage on the network.</p>


            <p>
            <h2> Data virtualization</h2>
            Modern enterprises store data from multiple applications, using multiple file formats, in multiple
            locations, ranging from the cloud to on-premise hardware and software systems. Data virtualization lets any
            application access all of that data—irrespective of source, format, or location.</p>
            <img src="img/data%20virtualization.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br>
            <br>
            <p> Data virtualization tools create a software layer between the applications accessing the data and the
                systems storing it. The layer translates an application’s data request or query as needed and returns
                results that can span multiple systems. Data virtualization can help break down data silos when other
                types
                of integration aren’t feasible, desirable, or affordable.</p>

            <p>
            <h2> Application virtualization</h2></p>
            <p> Application virtualization runs application software without installing it directly on the user’s OS.
                This
                differs from complete desktop virtualization (mentioned above) because only the application runs in a
                virtual environment—the OS on the end user’s device runs as usual. There are three types of application
                virtualization:</p>

            <p> Local application virtualization: The entire application runs on the endpoint device but runs in a
                runtime
                environment instead of on the native hardware.
                Application streaming: The application lives on a server which sends small components of the software to
                run
                on the end user's device when needed.
                Server-based application virtualizationThe application runs entirely on a server that sends only its
                user
                interface to the client device.
                Data center virtualization
                Data center virtualization abstracts most of a data center’s hardware into software, effectively
                enabling an
                administrator to divide a single physical data center into multiple virtual data centers for different
                clients.</p>

            <p> Each client can access its own infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which would run on the same
                underlying
                physical hardware. Virtual data centers offer an easy on-ramp into cloud-based computing, letting a
                company
                quickly set up a complete data center environment without purchasing infrastructure hardware.</p>

            <p>
            <h2>CPU virtualization</h2></p>
            <p> CPU (central processing unit) virtualization is the fundamental technology that makes hypervisors,
                virtual
                machines, and operating systems possible. It allows a single CPU to be divided into multiple virtual
                CPUs
                for use by multiple VMs.</p>
            <img src="img/operating-system-virtualization-400x321.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br>
            <br>

            <p> At first, CPU virtualization was entirely software-defined, but many of today’s processors include
                extended
                instruction sets that support CPU virtualization, which improves VM performance.</p>

            <p>
            <h2>GPU virtualization</h2></p>
            <p> A GPU (graphical processing unit) is a special multi-core processor that improves overall computing
                performance by taking over heavy-duty graphic or mathematical processing. GPU virtualization lets
                multiple
                VMs use all or some of a single GPU’s processing power for faster video, artificial intelligence (AI),
                and
                other graphic- or math-intensive applications.</p>

            <p> Pass-through GPUs make the entire GPU available to a single guest OS.
                Shared vGPUs divide physical GPU cores among several virtual GPUs (vGPUs) for use by server-based VMs.
                Linux virtualization
                Linux includes its own hypervisor, called the kernel-based virtual machine (KVM), which supports Intel
                and
                AMD’s virtualization processor extensions so you can create x86-based VMs from within a Linux host
                OS.</p>

            <p> As an open source OS, Linux is highly customizable. You can create VMs running versions of Linux
                tailored
                for specific workloads or security-hardened versions for more sensitive applications.</p>

            <p>
            <h2>Cloud virtualization</h2></p>
            <p> As noted above, the cloud computing model depends on virtualization. By virtualizing servers, storage,
                and
                other physical data center resources, cloud computing providers can offer a range of services to
                customers,
                including the following:</p>

            <p> Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): Virtualized server, storage, and network resources you can configure
                based on their requirements.
                Platform as a service (PaaS): Virtualized development tools, databases, and other cloud-based services
                you
                can use to build you own cloud-based applications and solutions.
                Software as a service (SaaS): Software applications you use on the cloud. SaaS is the cloud-based
                service
                most abstracted from the hardware.
